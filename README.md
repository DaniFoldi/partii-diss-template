# University of Cambridge CST Part II Dissertation template

**This is not an official template.**

The majority of the actual content is taken from [https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/projects/demodiss/diss.pdf](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/projects/demodiss/diss.pdf) by Martin Richards.

I have updated some parts of the dissertation to match the requirements (potentially updated since first uploaded), especially in the first 3 pages.

I have also added a Dependabot [configuration](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file) file and GitHub Actions jobs to build the dissertation (& the proposal separately) and try to make sure the output complies with the official requirements. **There is no guarantee that all issues are caught, or that the template matches all current requirements.**
